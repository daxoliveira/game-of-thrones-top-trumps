A digital version of the card game  "Top Trumps (Super Trunfo)" in which a single person plays against the machine.

Almost any computer browser.

When can I play it and is the game timed?
You can play anytime as long as you have a computer with internet connection. Also, this version of "Top Trumps" is not timed.

How can I play?
In order to win this game you have to take all of your opponent's cards.
 
Step 1: The first version of the game will consist of an even distribution of 32 cards (more cards will be added as the game gets tested) between two players, the machine and you.

Step 2: To start the game, the window will display one card facing up (you) against another one facing down (the machine). 

Step 3: Each card will have a title, a picture, and three properties with numerical values. You will choose a property from your card to be compared against the faced down card's same property. The player with the highest property value wins the card.

Step 4: Once one of the players has won all the cards, he or she will be the game winner.
